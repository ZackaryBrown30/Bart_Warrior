Intended to be the lightest possible application for easy access in low connectivity zones. Built with Mobile users in mind, chrome/broswer native.

In order to make a clone of this app, you will need to add a file called key.js in your App's root directory and export a variable key: "Your-Key-Here", bart supplies a free public key that is prone to changing from time to time, or you may request a legacy key for your peronal use that will not in theory expire.

See server.js, in the Api calls the secure key was imported and supplies access.
